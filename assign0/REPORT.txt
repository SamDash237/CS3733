1. I sought out the assistance of the tutors in the CS lab. They explained how to get driver2.c to read.

2. I am not sure that everything I did is correct.

3. I am most unsure about driver1_output.txt, as that returns everything that I enter.

4. This was a challenging assignment. Though next time, making only one driver might be sufficient.
