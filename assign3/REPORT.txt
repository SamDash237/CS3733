1.) I mainly received help from the CS Lab tutors in figuring out the extra credit portion of the assignment.
2.) I do not think that everything I did is correct because the second test for part 3 produces a different md5sum output
than what Dr. Zhu described in his email to the class.
3.) Everything before assign3part3 128 4096 2048 part2sequence is working as expected. As for the second test in Part 3,
it still returns the total page faults and does not seg fault.
4.)Part 3 was the most challenging segment of this particular project.
5.)
Part 1:
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> cc -o assign3part1 assign3part1.c
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> assign3part1 part1sequence
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> md5sum output-part1
ceabc02825a5b908e474b053074ab53c  output-part1

Part 2:
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> gcc -o assign3part2 assign3part2.c phypages.c pagetable.c
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> assign3part2 part2sequence
Total page faults: 3210
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> md5sum output-part2
c95b27848ae8d4354d87678d075001f7  output-part2

Part 3:
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> cc -o assign3part3 assign3part3.c -lm phypages.c pagetable.c
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> assign3part3 256 4096 1024 part2sequence
Total page faults: 3324
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> md5sum output-part3
d34ec1b7d6aaa8d6eb093b9b95c8e094  output-part3

fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> assign3part3 128 4096 2048 part2sequence
Total page faults: 2130
fox01:~/cs3733/assign3> md5sum output-part3
87807c742d573a107fa6041e50dc957c  output-part3
I believe the first half of this implementation is correct because the md5sum of the output matches what the professor 
described in his email to the class. However, the second md5sum iteration does not match.
